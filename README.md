This is a personal portfolio website built with React and Node.js to showcase my projects, skills, and experience. It features a dynamic contact form that allows visitors to send messages directly to me. Messages are securely saved to a MongoDB database and trigger email notifications using Nodemailer, ensuring I receive every inquiry in real time. The design is clean, responsive, and optimized for all devices â€” making it a professional digital presence for connecting with potential employers, collaborators, or clients.
